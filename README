This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1456

Usage:
   This script adds two new command ":CopyPath" and ":CopyFileName".
   You can use the ":CopyPath" command to copy file path to clipboard,
   and you can use the ":CopyFileName" command to copy file name to clipboard.

   :CopyPath
       copy current editing file full path to clipboard.
       And, if you set g:copypath_copy_to_unnamed_register option to 1 then,
       copy file full path to unnamed register too.
       Default, not copy to unnamed register.

   :CopyFileName
       copy current editing file name to clipboard.
       And, if you set g:copypath_copy_to_unnamed_register option to 1 then,
       copy file name to unnamed register too.
       Default, not copy to unnamed register.

Configuration:
   g:copypath_copy_to_unnamed_register
      set this option value to 1 then, copy file path and name to `unnamedplus` register too.
      because there are two independent clipboards: PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD on Linux, and  `CLIPBOARD`
      is the `ctrl-c` and `ctrl-v` default register of X11 window system.
  >
      let g:copypath_copy_to_unnamed_register = 1

Note:
   o  To run this script, Vim needs to be compiled with "+clipboard" option.
